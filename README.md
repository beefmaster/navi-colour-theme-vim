This project changes the colours of the vim text editor to ones that resemble the colours of the exports team NaVi.


i was inspired by the Gotham colour scheme that whatyouhide made.

whatyouhides scheme can be found here: https://github.com/whatyouhide/vim-gotham 

hope you enjoy.

this is my first github repository that i have been fully committed to and am looking forward to see what it will become.
