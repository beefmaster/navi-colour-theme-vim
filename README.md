This project changes the colours of the vim text editor to ones that resemble the colours of the exports team NaVi.


i was inspired by the Gotham colour scheme that whatyouhide made.

whatyouhides scheme can be found here: https://github.com/whatyouhide/vim-gotham 

hope you enjoy.

this is my first github repository that i have been fully committed to and am looking forward to see what it will become.


Installation

I moved to vim-plug a while ago and never looked back. Anyway, you can install Gotham with whatever package manager you use. For example:

#THIS WAS COPIED FROM ANTOHER REPO AND WILL BE CHANGED SOON

" vim-plug
Plug 'whatyouhide/vim-gotham'
" NeoBundle
NeoBundle 'whatyouhide/vim-gotham'
" Vundle
Plugin 'whatyouhide/vim-gotham'
If you don't use a plugin manager just copy the content of vim/colors/ to ~/.vim/colors.

When you have the plugin installed, you can set it in your vimrc:

colorscheme gotham
